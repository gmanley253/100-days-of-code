# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Posted to LinkedIn to commit to the challenge. Worked on the simplifying multilinear polynomials challenge in CodeWars.com

**Thoughts:** The things I struggled with were including the positive/negative sign with the integer. Reading the number as an integer from a string does not include it. I also struggled with list splicing.

### Day 2: May 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my solution on the simplifying multilinear polynomials challenge in CodeWars.com

**Thoughts:** This was a challenging solution that showed how to extract items from a string, splice the list into sublists, perform a calculation, and combine to make a new string.
