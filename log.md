# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Posted to LinkedIn to commit to the challenge. Worked on the simplifying multilinear polynomials challenge in CodeWars.com

**Thoughts:** The things I struggled with were including the positive/negative sign with the integer. Reading the number as an integer from a string does not include it. I also struggled with list splicing.

### Day 1: May 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the simplifying multilinear polynomials challenge in CodeWars.com

**Thoughts:** The things I struggled with were aggregating the coefficients. Settled on Pandas group by as the solution.

### Day 2: May 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my solution on the simplifying multilinear polynomials challenge in CodeWars.com

**Thoughts:** This was a challenging solution that showed how to extract items from a string, splice the list into sublists, perform a calculation, and combine to make a new string.

### Day 3: May 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Installed Visual Studio today and started reading about Django. Worked on a function to find the max score of a word using it's unicode position. 

**Thoughts:** The best solution used a lambda function to find the max score. I would like to try more function using lambdas.
